Datasets Information
--------------------

Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data? Specify how you will use existing data.
Generate new data
Reuse existing data

I will only generate new data; existing data on [this topic] are sparse and inadequate because [give reansons].

Name and list here all datasets that will be used and/or generated in this project. Add a reference for existing datasets.

RNA-seq on Arabidopsis. Phenotype analysis by imaging. Arabidopsis dataset E-MTAB-XXXX.

Per dataset, state its purpose, explain the relation to the objectives of the project, specify to whom it will be useful.

RNA-seq and Phenotype datasets aim to clarify resistance mechanisms in Arabidopsis, as in objective 3 in this project. These datasets are interesting for food and chemical industries, for farmers associtions and politicians.

Per dataset, state its origin/source.

Datasets [Name] and [Name] are laboratory/field/preclinical experiments on [organism]

Per dataset, state digital format(s) of raw and processed data files, distinguishing proprietary from open format(s).

Arabidopsis RNA-seq raw data files are in .fastq open format and SRA propriatary format; processed data files are in .txt open format.

What methods or software tools are needed to access data files in private format? Is documentation about the software needed to open the datafile included? Is it possible to include the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?

Format [x] can only be open with the proprietary software [y]; no open format nor open software exists for this data type.

Per dataset, state its expected volume at the end of the project.

RNA-seq on Arabidopsis: 200 files are about 200GB

Datasets Sharing and Reuse
--------------------------

What dataset will be shared and made available AFTER the end of the project? Distinguish open access datasets from restricted or closed access datasets.

Question not answered.

Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data? Per dataset with restricted or closed access, provide a rationale for doing so.
Yes, Intellectual Property (IP): the researcher involved and the IP team shall make the necessary arrangements in order to maintain the embargo on the public access of research data, at least until the filing of a patent application has been done.
Yes, 3rd party agreement or classified data: the researcher involved and the Legal Team of the TechTransfer Office will specify the restrictions in this DMP.
Yes, ethical issues (personal/sensitive data): specify below.

GDPR approval

Per dataset with restricted access, explain how access will be provided (under what conditions or procedure).

Question not answered.

Per dataset, state what data repositories will be used for sharing data, metadata, code/software and related documentation.
In an Open Access repository

RNA-seq on Arabidopsis: ArrayExpress Open Access repository. Code on Github (Open access).

Per dataset, state when it will be made available. Is embargo forseen?
Upon publication of the research results



Per dataset, state how it will be licensed to permit the widest reuse possible. If the re-use of some data is restricted, explain why and specify the length of time for which the data will remain re-usable.
All datasets will follow the license policy of each data repository.



Documentation and Metadata
--------------------------

Will  metadata schema be used? Per dataset, state the existing or customized metadata standards that will be used.

Question not answered.

Do you make use of persistent identifiers or unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)?

Question not answered.

Will you use a controlled vocabolary or ontology to describe your data? Per dataset: state the existing ontology or the mapping of your vocabolary to the most used ontologies.

Question not answered.

What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of data collected/generated in this project?

Question not answered.

Costs for Datasets Sharing and Reuse
------------------------------------

What are the estimated costs for making data FAIR?

Question not answered.

How will these costs (for making data FAIR) be covered?

Question not answered.

What are the expected costs for data sharing and reuse?

Question not answered.

How will these costs (for data sharing and reuse) be covered?

Question not answered.

(Meta)Data Storage During the Project
-------------------------------------

Where will the data be stored during the project?

Question not answered.

What is the backup frequencing?

Question not answered.

Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.

Question not answered.

What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project?

Question not answered.

How will these costs (for data storage and backup during the project) will be covered?

Question not answered.

Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored (not accessed or modified by unauthorized persons), especially for senstive data.

Question not answered.

(Meta)Data Long Term Preservation
---------------------------------

List which datasets will be preserved or not, for at least 10 years after the end of the project and explain why (legal, contractual restrictions etc..)

Question not answered.

Where will datasets be stored for long term (archived) after the end of the project?

Question not answered.

Estimate the costs for long term preservation (or archiving).

Question not answered.

How will these costs (for long term preservation) be covered?

Question not answered.

Data security: is datasets safely archived in certified repositories?

Question not answered.

(Meta)Data quality
------------------

Describe data quality assurance processes and who will be responsible for it.

Question not answered.

Who will be responsible for the data documentation and metadata?

Question not answered.

Who will be responsible for data storage and backup during the poject?

Question not answered.

Who will be responsible for ensuring data preservation and sharing?

Question not answered.

Who bears the end responsibility for updating and implementing this DMP?

Question not answered.

Ethical and Legal Issues
------------------------

Will you use personal/sensitive data? If so, shortly describe the kind of personal data you will use AND add the reference to your file in your host institution's privacy register.

Question not answered.

Are there any ethical issues concerning the creation and/or use of the data (e.g. experiments on humans or animals, dual use)? If so, add the reference to the formal approval by the relevant ethical review committee(s).

Question not answered.

Will Intellectual property restrictions be claimed for your data? If so, for what data and which restrictions will be asserted?

Question not answered.

Do existing 3rd party agreements restrict dissemination or exploitation of the data you (re)use? If so, to what data do they relate and what restrictions are in place?

Question not answered.
