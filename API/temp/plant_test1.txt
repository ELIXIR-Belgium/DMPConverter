Datasets Information
--------------------

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Will you generate/collect new data and/or make use of existing data? Specify how you will use existing data.
Generate new data
Reuse existing data

Data from public repositories will be used for genome sequences and expression of genes
New proteomics datasets will be generated

[ERC] Name and list here all datasets that will be used and/or generated in this project. Add a reference for existing datasets.

Previously published and available from public repositories datasets on genome and transcriptomics will be used
Datasets for proteomic changes under specific conditions will be generated

[H2020] Per dataset, state its purpose, explain the relation to the objectives of the project, specify to whom it will be useful.

Published genomic datasets will be used to map
New proteomics datasets will be primarily used to identify candidates

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Per dataset, state its origin/source.

Genomics and transcriptomics datasets are used from TAIR
Proteomics is generated in house

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Per dataset, state digital format(s) of raw and processed data files, distinguishing proprietary from open format(s).

GEnomics and TRanscriptomics are digital and in open .gb
Proteomics come from the machine and are ME proprietary format but processed as open source format OpenProt

[ERC, H2020] What methods or software tools are needed to access data files in proprietary format? Is documentation about the software needed to open the data file provided in the metadata? Is it possible to provide the relevant software (e.g. in open source code)?

Machine files are accessed by MachineCoSoftware
Â 

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Per dataset, state its expected volume at the end of the project.

Proteomics dataset is expected to be 50GB

Datasets Sharing and Reuse
--------------------------

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Which datasets will be shared and made available (for the society) after the end of the project? Distinguish open access datasets from restricted or closed access datasets.

All proteomics datasets will be made available upon completion of project on PRIDE repository

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Are there any factors restricting or preventing the sharing of (some of) the data? Per dataset with restricted or closed access, provide a rationale for doing so.
Yes, Intellectual Property (IP): the researcher involved and the IP team shall make the necessary arrangements in order to maintain the embargo on the data access, at least until essential steps in securing intellectual property have been taken.



[FWO, ERC, H2020] Per dataset, list the repositories in which data, metadata, code, software and related documentation will be shared. If research materials and protocols will be shared in centralised repositories, specify it below.
In an Open Access repository

PRIDE

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Per dataset with restricted access, explain how access will be provided (under what conditions or procedure).

No datsets will have restricted access

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Per dataset, state when it will be made available. Is embargo foreseen?
Upon publication of the research results



[ERC, H2020] Per dataset, state how it will be licensed to permit the widest re-use possible. If the re-use of some data is restricted, explain why and specify the length of time for which the data will remain re-usable.
Each dataset will follow the license policy of the repository in which it will be shared.



Documentation and Metadata
--------------------------

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Will a metadata scheme be used? Per dataset, state the standard metadata or the customized metadata schemes that will be used.
Yes. Each dataset will follow the metadata scheme of the repository in which it will be shared.



[ERC, H2020] Do you make use of persistent identifiers or unique identifiers such as Digital Object Identifiers (DOI)?
Each dataset will have the identifiers or accession numbers provided by the repository in which it will be shared.



[ERC, H2020] Will you use a controlled vocabulary or standard ontology to describe your data? Per dataset, state the standard ontologies you will use or the mapping of your vocabulary to standard ontologies.
Each dataset will use the ontology supported by the repository in which it will be shared.



[FWO, H2020] What documentation will be provided to enable understanding and reuse of data collected/generated in this project?
Other. Specify below.

Metadata will be provided according to the respositorie's specification

Costs for Datasets Sharing and Reuse
------------------------------------

[H2020] What are the estimated costs for making data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)?

12345679

[H2020] How will these costs (for making data FAIR) be covered?

The project will cover these costs

[FWO, ERC, H2020] What are the expected costs for data sharing and reuse?
Data will be shared and made available in public repositories which are free of charge.



[FWO, ERC, H2020] How will these costs (for data sharing and reuse) be covered?

No costs for sharing

(Meta)Data Storage During the Project
-------------------------------------

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Where will the data be stored during the project?

Data will be stored in the datacenter

[FWO, ERC, H2020] What is the backup strategy?

Data is backed up on site and remotely by IT team

[FWO] Is there currently sufficient storage & backup capacity during the project? If yes, specify concisely. If no or insufficient storage or backup capacities are available, then explain how this will be taken care of.
Yes. See details below.

The center has enough data storage allocatedfor this project

[FWO, ERC, H2020] What are the expected costs for data storage and backup during the project?

3000EUR

[FWO, ERC, H2020] How will these costs (for data storage and backup during the project) be covered?

The project will cover this cost

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Data security: how will you ensure that the data are securely stored (not accessed or modified by unauthorised persons), especially for sensitive data.

Standard Data security strategies are used by the IT team

(Meta)Data Long Term Preservation
---------------------------------

[FWO, ERC, H2020] List which datasets will be preserved or not, for at least 5-10 years after the end of the project and explain why (legal, contractual restrictions etc..).

proteomics will be

[FWO, ERC, H2020] Where will datasets be stored for long term (archived) after the end of the project?
The same repositories used for data sharing will ensure long term storage.



[FWO, ERC, H2020] Estimate the costs for long term preservation (or archiving).
The chosen data repositories provide long term storage free of charge.



[FWO, ERC, H2020] How will these costs (for long term preservation) be covered?
No costs expected.



[ERC, H2020] Data security: are the datasets safely stored in repositories for long term preservation and curation?
Yes, the chosen data repositories will ensure data security.
